# React Slideshow Project

This is a project I've been working on for a little bit by myself to learn React. I thought I should upload it here in case anyone wants to use it.
This implementation also includes Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com).
If you want any features added, please let me know.

## Features

Current features include:

- Slideshow functionality
- The ability to set image set
- The ability to add images to the current set
- Ability to fullscreen the image
- Ability to go forward or backwards through images
- Ability to set timer for image automatically changing
- (partially implemented) Tracking gif lengths to accurately play all the way through before changing image

## Controls

- Move forward through images: D key or Right Arrow Key
- Move backward through images: A key or Left Arrow Key
- Fullscreen within page: W key or Up Arrow Key
- Autoplay: C key

## Planned Features

- Better video functionality
- Support more types of images and videos
- Rework the timer
- Finish gif functionality + add it to videos
- Auto-video playing / possibly different player
- Menus with more settings
- Delay on changing timer length
- Possible custom API access so custom slideshows can be played directly from another source.
